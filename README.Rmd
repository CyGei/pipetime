`pipetime` measures the runtime of a pipeline from its start up to the `time_pipe()` call. It works with the native R pipe (`|>`) and integrates seamlessly into '*tidy workflows*'.

# Installation
```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("CyGei/pipetime")
library(pipetime)
library(dplyr)
```

# Example
Place `time_pipe()` anywhere in a pipeline to measure elapsed time from the start up to that point.
```{r}
data.frame(x = 1:3) |>
  mutate(sleep = Sys.sleep(0.1)) |> # e.g. a complex operation
  summarise(mean_x = mean(x)) |>
  time_pipe("total pipeline") # ~0.1 sec
```

Insert multiple `time_pipe()` calls to add *timestamps* along the pipeline:
```{r}
complex_fn <- function(duration,x) {
  Sys.sleep(duration)  # Simulate a time-consuming operation
  rnorm(n = length(x), mean = x, sd = 1)
}

data.frame(x = 1:5) |> 
  mutate(y = complex_fn(0.5, x)) |>
  time_pipe("compute y") |> 
  mutate(z = complex_fn(0.5, y)) |> 
  time_pipe("compute z") |>
  summarise(mean_z = mean(z)) |>
  time_pipe("total pipeline")
    
```

Each `time_pipe()` reports the cumulative time since the start of the pipeline.

# Logging to a dataframe
Save timings to a dataframe in the packageâ€™s private environment (`.pipetime_env`) with the `log` argument:
```{r}
df_1 <- data.frame(x = 1:5) |> 
  mutate(y = complex_fn(0.5, x)) |>
  time_pipe("compute y", log = "timings")

df_2 <- df_1 |> 
  mutate(z = complex_fn(0.5, y)) |>
  time_pipe("compute z", log = "timings")

get_log("timings")
rm_log("timings") # delete "timings" from .pipetime_env
```

Set a global default for the session using: `options(pipetime.log = "timings")`.
